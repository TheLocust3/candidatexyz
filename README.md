Big To-Do's:
- Emails (formatting, unsubscribe)
- Contact list
- Volunteer list
- Staff management
  - Add users by email
  - Manage users page

Misc To-Do's:
- Javascript form validation
- Allow text of buttons to be editable
- Optimize store to not pull full postTypes and other pulls like that (also don't pull user repeatedly)

Bugs:
- Clicking anywhere inside slideshow content will trigger editor (when editing)
- After editing, screen doesn't shrink back to normal size
- Little white line on left of parallax header after some window resizes
- Admin overlay blocks click

Cleanup:
- Create form superclass (things like renderErrors)
- Make contents DRY
- Use a hash to pass arguments to api functions
- Add panels folder
- Add forms folder
