Misc To-Do's:
- Javascript form validation
- Allow text of buttons to be editable
- Make contents DRY
- Use redux to set background AND pull the image
- Optimize redux store to serve up resources already in the store instead of pulling the same resources over again

Bugs:
- Clicking anywhere inside slideshow content will trigger editor (when editing)
- After editing, screen doesn't shrink back to normal size
- Little white line on left of parallax header after some window resizes
- Admin overlay blocks click

Cleanup:
- Create form superclass (things like renderErrors)
